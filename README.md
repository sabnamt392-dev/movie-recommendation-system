# Movie Recommendation System 🎬

This project implements a **Movie Recommendation System using Python**. The system analyzes movie data and recommends similar movies based on content similarity. It is developed as an academic project using data preprocessing and basic machine learning techniques.

---

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to build a recommendation system that suggests movies to users based on similarities between movie features. The system uses a **content-based filtering approach**, where recommendations are generated by comparing attributes of movies.

This project was developed as part of a **Computer Engineering academic curriculum**.

## 📊 Dataset Description

The dataset (`mymoviedb.csv`) contains movie-related information such as:
- Movie titles
- Genres and features
- Other attributes required for similarity calculation

The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values and ensure consistency.

## ⚙️ Methodology

1. Load the movie dataset using Pandas  
2. Perform data cleaning and preprocessing  
3. Extract relevant features for recommendation  
4. Compute similarity between movies using machine learning techniques  
5. Generate movie recommendations based on similarity scores

## ▶️ How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sabnamt392-dev/movie-recommendation-system.git
```
2.Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3.Open the Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```
4.Run all cells in movie_recommendation.ipynb

Output:
The system outputs a list of recommended movies similar to the selected movie based on calculated similarity scores.

 Academic Purpose:
This project is intended for educational use and demonstrates the application of data analysis and machine learning concepts in building recommendation systems.

Future Enhancements:
Implement collaborative filtering

Improve recommendation accuracy

Develop a web interface using Streamlit

Deploy the system as a web application
